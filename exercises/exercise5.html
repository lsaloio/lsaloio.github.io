            <h1>About Me - Lauren Saloio</h1>
            <hr >
            
                <p>I am a senior at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, studying English with a Certificate in Professional Writing and Technical Communication. As an aspiring Technical Writer, I am especially interested in data science and software development.</p>

                <p>During the current spring semester, I am interning with the <a href="https://ds.cs.umass.edu/industry/data-science-common-good">Data Science for the Common Good</a> team at the Center for Data Science at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Through this internship opportunity and the Professional Writing and Technical Communication Certificate Program, I have been able to connect my passion for both writing and technology with my career path.</p>
