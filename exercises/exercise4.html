            <h1><strong>Possible images for my portfolio website</strong></h1>
            <h2>Image #1</h2>
                <p>I chose this image because reading is one of my favorite hobbies. The person in the image is holding lemonade, which is also my favorite beverage to drink during the summer.</p>

            <h2>Image #2</h2>
                <p>I chose this image because I love the beach and watching the sunset. I also hope to live closer to the coast someday, so I thought this image was fitting.</p>

            <h2>Image #3</h2>
                <p>I chose this image because the coding on the MacBook screen reminds me of my internship with the Center for Data Science. It also reminds me of the assignments I am currently doing in my PWTC courses. Learning to code has become very exciting to me, and I hope to continue learning as much as I can.</p>

            <h2>Image #4</h2>
                <p>I chose this image because I love to write. It is at the center of my major and potential career in technical writing. It also very important to me outside of that, since I love to journal and write down to-do lists.</p>
