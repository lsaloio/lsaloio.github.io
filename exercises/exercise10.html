                <p>I am a senior at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, studying English with a Certificate in Professional Writing and Technical Communication. After I graduate in May of 2023, I plan to pursue a career in technical writing. As someone that has always been interested in science/technology and reading/writing, I knew technical writing would be the perfect career path for me. I am also very excited about learning new things related to technology and especially software, which has also inspired my passion for technical writing.</p>
                <p>I am currently interning with the <a href="https://ds.cs.umass.edu/industry/data-science-common-good">Data Science for the Common Good</a> team at the Center for Data Science at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Through this internship opportunity and the Professional Writing and Technical Communication Certificate Program, I have been able to connect my passion for both writing and technology with my career path.</p>
                <p>Through my internship, I have had the opportunity to apply skills in Git and GitHub, Markdown, VS Code, command lines, and more in order to edit and write technical documentation. I have also been working on updating website designs and content for the Center for Data Science. This has been a great opportunity for me to apply what I have learned in the PWTC certificate program and has solidified my passion for this career path.</p>
                <p>In addition to technical writing, I have strong interests in:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>UX and UI design</li>
                    <li>Frontend development</li>
                    <li>Data science</li>
                </ul>
