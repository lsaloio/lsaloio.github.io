                <p> As someone that has always been interested in science/technology and reading/writing, I knew technical writing would be the perfect career path for me.
                    This semester, I interned as a Technical Writer for the Center for Data Science at UMass Amherst. Through my internship, I had the opportunity to apply skills in Git, Markdown, VS Code, command lines, and more in order to edit and write technical documentation. I also worked on writing and editing content for the Center's in-progress website. This has been a great opportunity for me to apply what I have learned in the PWTC certificate program, and has solidified my passion for this career path.
