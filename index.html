                <p class="fancy-text"><em>I am a recent graduate from the University of Massachusetts Amherst, where I received a Bachelor's in English and a Certificate in Professional Writing and Technical Communication.</em></p>
                <p> I have always been interested in science/technology and reading/writing, so I knew technical writing would be the perfect career path for me.
                    During my last semester, I interned as a Technical Writer for the <strong>Center for Data Science at UMass Amherst</strong>. Through my internship, I had the opportunity to apply skills in Git, Markdown, VS Code, command lines, and more in order to edit and write technical documentation. I also worked on writing and editing content for the Center's in-progress website. 
                    After I graduated in May of 2023, I spent the summer interning at <strong>NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center</strong> where I did technical writing for their Spacecraft Telecomm Systems.

                <p class="fancy-text"><em> I currently work for the Center for Data Science and Research Computing & Data at UMass Amherst as a Communications Manager and Technical Writer. I am always looking for freelance opportunities where I can use my passion as a writer, learner, and communicator of complex technical topics.
